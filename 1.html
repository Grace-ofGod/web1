Based on Federal Trade Commission's USA Made standards, AAFCO describes “Made in USA” pet food labeling:</p>
<img src="coding.jpg" width="500">
<p style = "margin-top:45px"> “…all or virtually all” means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of US origin. That is, the product should contain no – or negligible – foreign content. So just putting together ingredients in the US is not enough. Additionally, just getting ingredients from a broker within the US is not enough. If ingredients are imported, then it is very difficult to justify the use of the phrase “Made in the USA.” So, to assume that a dog food with a “Made in the USA” label is made with ingredients of US origin is not unreasonable, according to what FTC and AAFCO encourages pet food manufacturers and companies to do. But as it happens, the AAFCO has no actual regulatory authority. AAFCO regulations are merely used as a “guideline” for pet food companies to follow in order to have their products licensed by the state in which they’re sold, and FTC is known for caring very little about the pet food manufacturing laws.
